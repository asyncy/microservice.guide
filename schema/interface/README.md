# Interfacing

Since the underlying execution strategy for an action can be a command, a HTTP request, or a RPC call, 
each action **MUST** provide an interface for it to be executed:

## HTTP

<Badge text="actions.$.http" type="info"/>

An `action` **MAY** use the HTTP protocol to execute it's function.

```yaml
actions:
  convert:
    http:
      port: 8080
      method: get
      path: /convert
```

<json-table>
<p>
{
    "method": {                                                          
        "desc": "The HTTP method to be used - one of get/post/put/delete/patch",
        "required": true
    },
    "port": {                                                          
        "desc": "The port on which the connection must be established.",
        "required": true
    },
    "path": {                                                          
        "desc": "The path for this action to be executed",
        "required": true
    },
    "contentType": {                                                              
        "desc": "The Content-Type for the request body. If any of your arguments have the field `in` set to `requestBody`, they'll be encoded with this Content-Type specified"
    }  
}
</p>
</json-table>

### Platform to Server

In this communication method the Service's HTTP server **MUST** be already running and waiting for connections.
The Platform will make HTTP requests to the server which results in a response body of data which the Platform would handle.

```bash
+------------+         +----------+
|            |         |          |
|  Platform  |         |  Server  |
|            |         |          |
+-----+------+         +-----+----+
      |                      |
      |  {"word": "hello"}   |
      | -------------------> |
      |                      |
      |    {"length": 5}     |
      | <------------------- |
      |                      |
```

### Location of arguments in the HTTP request

All types of HTTP requests will apply arguments based on the specified `in` of the argument.

The below example shows a `GET` request with a query and path parameter.

```yaml{4,5,6,7,8,9,13}
actions:
  fetch_usd:
    arguments:
      units:
        type: int
        in: query
      currency:
        type: string
        in: path
    output:
       type: int
    http:
      port: 8080
      method: get
      path: /fetch_usd/{currency}
```

*Path parameters **MUST** be specified in the `path`*

```sh
$ curl -X GET http://service:8080/fetch_usd/eur?units=100
```

This next example is a `POST` where data is passed via the body.

```yaml{4,5,6,7,8,9}
actions:
  fetch_usd:
    arguments:
      units:
        type: int
        in: requestBody
      currency:
        type: string
        in: requestBody
    output:
      type: int
    http:
      contentType: application/json
      method: post
      path: /convert
```

```sh
$ curl -X POST http://service:8080/path -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"currency": "eur", "units": 100}'
```

## Command

<Badge text="actions.$.format" type="info"/>

If the container provider is Docker, then `docker exec` is used:

### Docker Run/Exec
Docker run/exec can be used as an interface for execution **and** communication.
Data is transmitted using standard output. Arguments can be used to pass values to the container.

**Sample**

```yaml
actions:
  count:
    format:
      command: ["/app/count.sh"]
    arguments:
      word:
        type: string
    output:
      type: int
```

<json-table>
<p>
{
    "command": {                                                          
        "desc": "The command to be executed. This may either be an array of strings, or a single string instead. An array of strings is **RECOMMENDED**",
        "required": true
    }
}
</p>
</json-table>

```sh
$ docker run --rm alpine /app/count.sh '{"word": "hello"}'
5
```

### Output
- The Service **MAY** write data to `stdout` which is considered the result of the operation.
- The Service **MUST** `exit 0` if it performed the operations successfully.

### Fail and Traceback
- If the Service fails to process the request, it **MUST** `exit 1` or `exit 2`.
- Data written to `stdout` is ignored when the exit code is greater than `0`.
- Data written to `stderr` **SHOULD** be traceback details.

#### Deterministic Failure
- The Service **MAY** exit with code `1` if it failed to performed the operation.
- An `exit 1` will inform the Platform *not* to process the command as the failure is deterministic.

#### Retry Failure
- The Service **MAY** exit with code `2` which indicates a failure and the Platform **SHOULD** retry.


#### Data Flow

     |    {"word": "hello"}      |                                                  |

     |                           |  --------------------------------------------->  |
     |                           |                     5                            |
     |                           |  <---------------------------------------------  |
     |      {"length": 5}        |                                                  |
     | <------------------------ |                                                  |
     |                           |                                                  |
```

## RPC

<Badge text="actions.$.rpc" type="info"/>

The Service **MAY** communicate via RPC.

The Service **MUST** define server and framework attributes.

```yaml
rpc:
  port: 8080
  framework:
    grpc:
      version: 2
      proto:
        path: git@github-server:project/repo.git/path/to/api.proto # Any valid URI path can be used
  client:
    endpoint: service
    port: 8080
    tls: true
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Heads up!
TLS configuration is defined separately. See the [authentication](/schema/authentication) section for details.
