# Health Checks

A service **SHOULD** provide health checks to ensure that the Platform knows of it's current state.
Services are consistently down will be terminated and restarted.

**Sample**

```yaml
health:
  http:
    path: /health
    port: 5000
```

## What's considered healthy

Your health check **MUST** be a HTTP GET endpoint returning a `2xx` or `3xx` code when it's `healthy`.
